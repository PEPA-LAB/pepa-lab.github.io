				In fields where the green grasses sway,
				The pigs do their work night and day.
				With snouts to the earth, they plow and they till,
				Aerating the soil with natural skill.

				Omnivorous beings, they eat without waste,
				From scraps and leftovers, nothing is placed.
				In forests and farms, they play their part,
				Helping the land with a natural heart.

				Through rooting and turning, the soil comes alive,
				With nutrients spread, the plants will thrive.
				In ecosystems complex, they hold a key,
				Pigs, the unsung heroes, for all to see.
