<h3>Our unofficial mascot</h3>



<div class="clearfix mb-3">

				In fields where the green grasses sway,<br>
				The pigs do their work night and day.<br>
				With snouts to the earth, they plow and they till,<br>
				Aerating the soil with natural skill.<br><br>

				Omnivorous beings, they eat without waste,<br>
				From scraps and leftovers, nothing is placed.<br>
				In forests and farms, they play their part,<br>
				Helping the land with a natural heart.<br><br>

				Through rooting and turning, the soil comes alive,<br>
				With nutrients spread, the plants will thrive.<br>
				In ecosystems complex, they hold a key,<br>
				Pigs, the unsung heroes, for all to see.<br>
