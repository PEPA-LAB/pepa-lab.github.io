  title: Welcome to our lab website ! 
  body: >

    We are the <b>Plant Ecology, ecoPhysiology and sustainable Agriculture lab</b>, from the Earth and Life Institute [Agronomy] from the UCLouvain, in Belgium. We are {{counterPeople}} entousiatic people studying how plant grow, how they are influenced by their environment (biotic and abiotic) and how people cultivate them. 

    <br><br>

    We have a soft spot for #roots, #hydraulics, #cereals, #pollinators, #market _gardenning, #sustainable_farming and #computational_tools.
